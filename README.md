#### Center for Assessment Colloquium

Each year, professional staff at the [Center for Assessment](http://www.nciea.org/) identify an area which is outside of our current areas of expertise, but is likely to have a significant impact on the field and our work in the near future.  Over the course of the year, Center associates gather information on the topic, identify and interact
with experts in the field, and develop a set of critical questions to be answered.  The culmination of this effort is a two-day meeting in May in which experts are convened to share information and engage in discussions with Center staff.


#### Goals for the 2018 Colloquium

1. Develop an understanding of and providing the rationale for the concept of “open”

    a.	Provide definitions and examples of terms such as “open source”, “open educational resources”, and “openness”.

    b.	Describe the requirements for building the “legal infrastructure” for open educational resources.

2. Investigate the confluence between open educational resources and the areas of educational assessment and accountability.

    a.	Establish working definitions of open assessment and open accountability.

    b.	Create an awareness and understanding of the state-of-the-art in open educational resources as well as open educational assessment and accountability resources.

3. Develop an understanding of how “open” transforms what we at the Center do and how we at the Center do it.

    a.	Understanding barriers and challenges to transitioning from the current state to one built around open educational resources.

    b.	Understanding business models related to open source and open educational resources.

    c.	Planning a smooth transition.

    d.	Reflecting on the potential for transforming assessment and accountability.

4. Model open development with the colloquium itself:

    a. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository and an associated [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website to hold/show all content related to the
    colloquium.

    b. Work with presenters so that all materials provided are open source (or help convert them).
